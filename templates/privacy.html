                <p>
                    Welcome to HBNI Audio Streaming Service. This is an
                    open-source project licensed under the MIT License. We
                    respect your privacy and are committed to maintaining
                    transparency about how this app operates and the data it
                    collects.
                </p>

                <h5>1. Data We Collect</h5>
                <p>
                    This app does not collect personal data from users. However,
                    the following data is collected for functionality:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Playback Statistics:</strong> How often an
                        archive is played and the last time it was accessed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Broadcast Archives:</strong> All public
                        broadcasts are archived and stored as part of the audio
                        archive. Private broadcasts are not saved, recorded, or
                        archived.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2. Push Notifications</h5>
                <p>
                    This app sends push notifications for the following
                    purposes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Notifying users of scheduled events.</li>
                    <li>Notifying users of live events.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>3. Scheduling and Broadcasting</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Users can schedule events using a password for
                        authentication.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users with the correct password can broadcast audio
                        through the app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All public broadcasts will be archived and stored in the
                        app's audio archive for future playback.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Private broadcasts are excluded from archiving and
                        recording to ensure privacy.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4. Open Source Commitment</h5>
                <p>
                    This app is open source and available under the MIT License.
                    The code is publicly accessible, and users can verify its
                    behavior and privacy practices.
                </p>

                <h5>5. Data Security</h5>
                <p>
                    We take reasonable measures to ensure the limited data
                    collected (playback statistics and broadcast archives) is
                    securely stored. No personal data is collected, processed,
                    or stored.
                </p>

                <h5>6. Your Rights</h5>
                <p>
                    As this app does not collect personal data, there are no
                    user-specific data rights beyond the ability to opt out of
                    receiving push notifications via your device settings.
                </p>

                <h5>7. Contact</h5>

                    We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy as
